     <li>Arabic coffee is a version of the brewed coffee of Coffea arabica beans.
        Most Arab countries throughout the Middle East have developed distinct methods for brewing and preparing coffee. 
        Cardamom is an often-added spice,but it can alternatively be served plain or with sugar.
      There are several different styles to brewing the coffee depending on the preference of the drinker.
       Some methods keep the coffee light whereas others can make it dark. Arabic coffee is bitter, 
       and typically no sugar is added. It is usually served in a small cup that is adorned with a decorative pattern, known as a finjān.
        Culturally, Arabic coffee is served during family gatherings or when receiving guests. </li>

         kaffɛ amerikano; Spanish: café americano, lit.American coffee)
          is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso shot with hot water at a 1:3 to 1:4 ratio,
           resulting in a drink that retains the complex flavors of espresso, but in a lighter way.

  <li>Japan has a coffee culture that has changed with societal needs over time.
     Today, coffee shops serve as a niche within their urban cultures.
      While it was introduced earlier in history, 
      during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by Dutch and Portuguese traders,
       it rapidly gained popularity at the turn of the twentieth century.
        It supports the social aspects of Japan,
         serving both as a space to connect but also to alleviate oneself from social pressures.
         Coffee is also defined by class interactions and classicist behaviors
          and has economic influence through the mass amount of import of coffee and the mass
           consumption of coffee in Japan in its many different forms</li>
